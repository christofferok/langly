Simple app to scan Laravel app for `__("String to be translated")` and manage the .json translation files. Heavily inspired by [https://github.com/themsaid/laravel-langman-gui](https://github.com/themsaid/laravel-langman-gui). No need to install any Laravel packages. Just launch the app and drag (or open) a directory into the app. 

## Download
Download one of the prebuilt apps from [https://github.com/christofferok/langly/releases](https://github.com/christofferok/langly/releases) 

## Usage

Any .json language files managed with the app will be overwritten on save, so make sure you use git or keep a backup of your files ðŸ˜Š
